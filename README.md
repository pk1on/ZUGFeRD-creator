# ZUGFeRD-creator
Simple script to create ZUGFeRD conform pdf file out of a ordinary pdf and a xml. Uses [ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) to make pdf compatible and [factur-x lib by akretion](https://github.com/akretion/factur-x). Both need to be installed for the script to work.
In order to use, place your pdf and xml in the same folder as the script and run it.
